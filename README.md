# Exodus

**Exodus** is a powerful and flexible command-line application designed to facilitate seamless backup and restore operations across distributed systems. The app is built to automate the process of securely backing up files and databases to cloud storage, such as Amazon S3, and restoring them on demand. 

## Features

- **Automated Backups**: Reads configuration files to locate and back up files and databases, compresses them, and securely uploads them to a cloud storage bucket.
- **Cross-Instance Operation**: Enables communication between different instances to coordinate backup and restore processes efficiently.
- **Cloud Integration**: Creates and manages temporary cloud storage (e.g., S3 buckets) on the fly, ensuring a smooth and automated backup experience.
- **Secure Restore**: Restores files and databases from cloud storage to the target instance, ensuring data integrity and availability.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable to support additional cloud providers and databases.

## Use Cases

- **Disaster Recovery**: Provides a reliable solution for automating backups and restores, ensuring critical data is safely stored and quickly recoverable.
- **Cross-Environment Data Transfer**: Facilitates moving data between different environments, such as development, testing, and production, by automating the backup and restore process.
- **Scalable Backup Solutions**: Supports large-scale distributed systems by enabling automated, instance-based backups and restores.
